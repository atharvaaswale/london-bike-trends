Welcome to **LondonBikeRidesAnalysis**! This project dives into the world of bike-sharing in London, exploring how weather, seasons, and holidays influence ride patterns. The repository features a Jupyter Notebook that preprocesses and cleans a bike rides dataset, making it ready for deeper analysis or visualization. Get ready to pedal through data!

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bike-sharing trends in London to uncover insights driven by weather conditions, seasons, holidays, and weekends. The Jupyter Notebook processes hourly bike ride data, performing tasks like:
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Converting humidity to a 0-1 scale
- Mapping numerical codes to readable labels (e.g., "winter" for season, "Clear" for weather)
- Saving the cleaned data as an Excel file (`london_bikes_final.xlsx`)

The result is a polished dataset ready for exploratory data analysis, visualizations, or predictive modeling!

## Dataset Description
The dataset (`london_merged.csv`) captures hourly bike ride counts in London, enriched with environmental and temporal features. Here’s what you’ll find:

- **time**: Timestamp of the record (hourly)
- **count**: Number of bike rides
- **temp_real_C**: Actual temperature in Celsius
- **temp_feels_like_C**: "Feels like" temperature in Celsius
- **humidity_percent**: Humidity as a percentage
- **wind_speed_kph**: Wind speed in kilometers per hour
- **weather**: Weather condition (e.g., Clear, Rain, Snowfall)
- **is_holiday**: Binary indicator for holidays (1 = holiday, 0 = non-holiday)
- **is_weekend**: Binary indicator for weekends (1 = weekend, 0 = weekday)
- **season**: Season of the year (spring, summer, autumn, winter)

The notebook transforms this data to make it more intuitive, scaling humidity and replacing codes with descriptive labels.

## Installation
Get started with these simple steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LondonBikeRidesAnalysis.git
   cd LondonBikeRidesAnalysis
   ```

2. **Set up a Python environment**:
   Use a virtual environment for a clean setup:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required libraries using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Usage
1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `london_bike_rides.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.

2. **Run the notebook**:
   - Ensure `london_merged.csv` is in the project directory or update the file path in the notebook.
   - Execute the cells step-by-step to preprocess the data and generate `london_bikes_final.xlsx`.

3. **Explore the output**:
   The cleaned dataset is saved as `london_bikes_final.xlsx`. Use it for further analysis, visualizations, or modeling!
